<h2>Who Am I?</h2>

<p>
Hello. I'm Rexy, a computer & information security enthusiast,<br> 
I play CTF and sometimes I do bug hunting, I love detective-kinda things.
Currently learning on security & computer science fields.
These are some of the things I've made and done.
And they'll probably come back to haunt me in a few years' time.
